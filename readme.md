### Learning jQuery

I built this as a learning project but now I use it every day.

It's a few lines of jQuery with the jQuery UI sortable plugin for dragging/dropping.

I used HTML 5 localstorage to save the state of your list when the browser window is closed. (Best disable this for development as it can be quite annoying...)
